## The rules

There are two players. A player picks the red color and the one picks the red color. Does not matter wich color starts first. Each turn the player places a piece of their representative color on an empty space on the table. The purpose of the game is for blue to connect a bath of hexes from the left side of the table to the right, and for red to connect the top side of the table to the bottom.

## Functionalities

ðŸ”¹ When you run the app, the first thing it asks is the settings for the game: how big the table do you want to have, the game mode (pvp, pve, eve), witch color the player picks (in pve) etc.
